# SMS-Contact--iOS

In iOS you cannot share contact via SMS. Only way is to copy paste numbers manually. To overcome this handicap i have developed this simple project to demonstrate use of Contacts framework. Following are the features of this project - 
  1. Display list of contacts who have phone numbers ( one or multiple ),
  2. Searching contact using UISearchbar,
  3. Tapping on a contact expands it to display all numbers under that contact,
  4. Share button launches MessagesUI with contact name and phone numbers. 

To run this project 
  1. install cocoapods (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20755044/how-to-install-cocoa-pods)
  2. follow instruction from above link to initialize it in this projects directory
  3. run "pod install" from project directory


*** Please change bundle ID to run / install this in your iPhone ***
